This mode allows you to study chaos. You can do that by looking at how the balls with close initial conditions move.
Another thing you can do is to draw a Poincare section of the phase space. <br> <br>

Creating balls. <br>
Before you create balls you can change the number of balls that will be created using rightmost slider. These balls will
have slightly different coordinates and velocity angles. Other two sliders allow you to change how much they will differ.
To create balls you right click on the screen. Then you give them velocity using the cue. <br> <br>

Poincare section<br>
Phase space of the system is four dimensional, so to look at the phase space we construct what's known as Poincare
section. We will plot information about the points where the balls collide with the edge of the table. To do that we
introduce new coordinate system. On the x axis we will plot the distance along the edge of the table between the first
vertex of the edge and the point of collision. On the y axis we will plot cosine of the angle between the edge and
velocity of the ball. <br>
To create a plot press "space". When you are finished, close the plot and press "space" again to continue playing. <br>
